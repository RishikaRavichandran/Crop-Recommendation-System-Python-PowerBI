# 🌾 Crop-Recommendation-System-Python-PowerBI
A Crop Recommendation System using Python (Random Forest Classifier) and Power BI for predicting suitable crops based on soil and weather conditions, with  data visualizations.


This project uses machine learning (Random Forest Classifier) to recommend the most suitable crop based on soil and environmental conditions, and presents results visually using a Power BI dashboard.
